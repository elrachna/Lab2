    <h2>Temple of Preah Vihear</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Temple of Preah Vihear</b> is an ancient Hindu temple located on
      the cliffs of the <del>Dângrêk</del> Mountains, in Cambodia, near the
      border with Thailand. It was primarily built during the reign of the Khmer
      Empire in <var>the 9th to 12th centuries,</var> dedicated to the deity
      Shiva. The temple's strategic position atop a <dfn>525-meter</dfn> cliff
      offers breathtaking views of the surrounding plains, emphasizing its role
      as a religious and symbolic center.

      <q>Preah Vihear</q> is noted for its well-preserved architecture and
      intricate stone carvings, reflecting the height of Khmer artistic
      achievement.
      <code>
        The temple complex was designed in a series of sanctuaries connected by
        a long,</code

      processional causeway, leading worshipers through various spiritual
      stages. Despite its religious origins, the site has been a source of
      tension between Cambodia and Thailand, with both nations claiming
      ownership due to its location. <strong>In 1962,</strong> the International
      Court of Justice ruled in favor of Cambodia, granting it sovereignty over
      the temple. In 2008, it was designated a <i>UNESCO</i>
      <u>World Heritage site,</u> cementing its status as a symbol of cultural
      and historical significance in Southeast Asia.
